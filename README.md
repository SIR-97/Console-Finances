## Console Finances calculations ##

For this challenge I utilised basic skills from what we learnt about JavaScript to calculate and make a console log of financial record for the given data. This was intriguing and as it showed the benefit of using JavaScript in real-life applications. By completeing this challenge, I was able to meet the following requirments:

 - The total number of months included in the dataset.

 - The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

 - The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

 - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

 - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
